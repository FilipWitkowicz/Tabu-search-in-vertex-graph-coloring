This repository contains a Tabu search implementation in a vertex graph coloring problem written in C++. The project was carried out as part of the Computational optimisation course.

Our task was to improve the results of 5 instances compared to the greedy algorithm's outcome as much as we could.


Results:

                      Queen6  Miles250  Le450_5a  Gc500  Gc1000
    Greedy algorithm    11      9         14         90    155
